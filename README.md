# Flexi Boards

Flexible, lightweight boards for organizing tasks, projects, and notes.

## Overview

Flexi Boards is a simple, extensible board system designed to help individuals and teams organize work with customizable columns, cards, and workflows. The project focuses on flexibility and ease of use, enabling users to create boards for task tracking, personal planning, project management, retrospectives, and more.

Key goals:
- Provide a highly configurable board layout
- Keep the interface intuitive and lightweight
- Make it easy to extend with custom fields and integrations

## Features

- Create multiple boards and columns
- Add, edit, and move cards between columns
- Support for card metadata (labels, due dates, assignees)
- Simple drag-and-drop interactions
- Extensible architecture for custom plugins and integrations

> Note: The word "lovable" has been removed from this README as requested.

## Who is this for?
